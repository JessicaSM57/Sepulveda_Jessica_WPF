//Jessica Sepulveda -- March 12, 2014 -- Assignment: Expressions

//Wacky: How much food will my dogs consume in their lifetime?

//Create prompt in an array format in order to establish age weight, life expectancy, and names.
var questions = [prompt("How much do your dog(s) weigh cumulatively?"), prompt("What is your dog(s) remaining life expectancy?"), prompt("What are your dog's names?")]; //This is an array.

//Given that a 40 pound dog consumes 3 cups of food per day the following equation is established:
var dailyFood = Number(questions[0]) / 40 * 3;

//Using life expectancy entered, this expression converts years to days and then multiplies

    console.log(food);
