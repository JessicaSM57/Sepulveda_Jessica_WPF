//Wacky: How much food will my dogs consume in their lifetime?

//Create prompt in an array format in order to establish age weight, life expectancy, and names.
var questions = [prompt("How much do your dog(s) weigh cumulatively?"), prompt("What is your dog(s) remaining life expectancy?"), prompt("What are your dog's names?")]; //This is an array.

//
var food = Number(questions[0]) * 24 *
    Number(sub[1]) + Number(sub[2]); //
    console.log(totalSub);
