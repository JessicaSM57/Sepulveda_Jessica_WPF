//Jessica Sepulveda -- March 12, 2014 -- Assignment: Expressions

//Personal: Are I spending money frivolously?

//Create prompt to establish givens and introduce data collection:
var income = prompt("According to NoMoreDebts.org, you should only spend 5% of your income on eating out, entertainment, and other discretionary expenses. \nPlease enter your adjusted monthly income for February.");

//Collect information from user:
var eatingOut = prompt("How much did you spend on eating out in February?");
var entertain = prompt("How much money did you spend on entertainment in February?");
var other = prompt("How much did you spend on other items including alcohol, gaming, hair cuts, hobbies, and recreation?");

//Built expressions using addition, division, and subtraction.
//var entry = [eatingOut, entertain, other]; //Built an array so the 3 entries can be treated as numbers versus text.
//var total = [entry[0] + entry[1] + entry[2]];
    console.log(total);
